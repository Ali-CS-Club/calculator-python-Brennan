This is Brennan’s personal Python calculator project for the ALI CS Club.  
It includes both:

- `cli/` – A terminal-based calculator using standard input/output.
- `gui/` – A graphical calculator built with Tkinter for a user-friendly interface.

Each version lives in its own folder and is powered by Python.
